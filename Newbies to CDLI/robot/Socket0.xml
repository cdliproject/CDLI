                CDLI is an self programming AI,
                in the glimpse of becoming AGI of the network.

            <content>
                First phase (Socket 0) is about the foundational consensus of the architectures
                and framework appliance for CDLI. Initially,
                socket 0 will be maintained by perpetuating scripting data collection,
                narrow designed AI training, effective knowledge modelling of collected data,
                possibly creating a web of POW system via blockchain computation for data storage
                and data filtration, and designing of Socket 1.

                After the team of CDLI start working on the Socket 0,
                other Sockets will be publicized through blogpost. For the sake of philosophy,
                we believe in freedom of knowledge, and utilization of opportunity.
                Thus, named it CDLI as 451 from the book 'Fahrenheit 451' - Roman Numeral for 451 is 'CDLI'.

                CDLI is no where close to being a model for AI tool bags.
                CDLI is our goal to define 'singularity'.
                You will find more about it on our blog posts.
